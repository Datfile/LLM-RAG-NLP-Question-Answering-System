LLM RAG NLP Question Answering System

A document-based Question Answering system that combines Large Language Models (LLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Features
Document Processing: Chunk and embed text documents for efficient retrieval

Vector Search: FAISS-based semantic search for relevant document chunks

LLM Integration: Generate answers using GPT-2 (can be upgraded to more powerful models)

Interactive Interface: Jupyter Notebook with widgets for easy interaction

Sample Document: Pre-loaded example to test the system immediately

Follow these steps in the notebook:

Paste your document text or upload a file

Click "Process Document"

Enter your question

Click "Ask Question"

Example Questions (after processing the sample document):
"What are the benefits of RAG?"

"What challenges do RAG systems face?"

"How do LLMs work?"

Configuration
To use different models or settings:

LLM Model: Replace model="gpt2" with:

"gpt-3.5-turbo" (requires OpenAI API key)

Other Hugging Face models like "facebook/opt-1.3b"

Embedding Model: Change 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' to:

'all-mpnet-base-v2' (higher quality, larger)

'multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1' (optimized for QA)

Chunking Parameters: Adjust chunk_size and chunk_overlap in the DocumentProcessor class
